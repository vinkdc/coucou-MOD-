# Coucou — guide for AI coding agents

Coucou is a native macOS app (`NotchBuddy/`); `windows/` is the Tauri version for Windows and Linux. Mochi, a small animated character living in the MacBook notch, shows AI coding agent sessions (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Antigravity and more) and a few integrations, and lets the user approve, answer, chat and drop files from the notch.

## Where things are
- `NotchBuddy/Sources/App/` — all Swift code. `NotchBuddy/Resources/sounds/` — the 28 WAV sounds. `NotchBuddy/project.yml` — XcodeGen project (never edit the `.xcodeproj` by hand).
- `NotchBuddy/Sources/App/PillCatalog.swift` — single source of truth for all declared pills (workspace tools, agents, AI providers, services). Every pill ID, color, category and subtitle lives here.
- `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md` — behaviour, views, states, integrations (in French).
- `design/prototype/notch-buddy.html` — original prototype, the visual source of truth. `design/captures/` — target screenshots.
- `windows/` — the Tauri app for Windows and Linux: Rust in `src-tauri/`, TypeScript in `src/`, the `coucou-hook` relay in `hook/`. `windows/README.md` lists what differs from the Mac.
- `docs/*.html` — the GitHub Pages site (privacy, terms, support, legal notice).

## Build
```
cd NotchBuddy && xcodegen && xcodebuild -scheme NotchBuddy -configuration Debug build
```
Windows and Linux: `cd windows && npm install && npm run tauri dev`

## Rules
- Swift 6, SwiftUI + AppKit. No third-party dependencies unless truly unavoidable. The character is drawn in code (`Canvas` + `TimelineView`), no Rive/Lottie/images.
- Secrets live in the Keychain, never on disk or in git.
- No telemetry. Network calls only to services the user configured.
- Never block Claude Code: if the app doesn't answer, the hook exits immediately.
- Never overwrite `~/.claude/settings.json`: dated backup, merge, show the diff, write only after the user confirms.
- Never send an email or approve a Claude Code permission without an explicit click.
- Performance: 0 % CPU when the island is hidden.
- Keep the bundle identifier `fr.louisraille.NotchBuddy` (Keychain items, preferences and permissions depend on it).
- Never restyle what already ships (pills, cards, Settings, chat…): existing views stay exactly as they are in `main`, which is the App Store build. Change the look of an existing view only when explicitly asked.
- Pill IDs are stable contract values (Keychain, UserDefaults, hook routing): never rename an existing pill ID.
- No white or light borders on UI surfaces (cards, panels, fields, chips, bubbles, buttons, code wells). Separate things with fill, tone and spacing; show focus by brightening the fill, never with a light ring. Dividers inside a surface are dark grooves, not light lines. A border tinted with a state or agent colour (the overview pills) is fine.
- Corners are concentric: a rounded shape nested in another gets the outer radius minus the gap between them, so the two curves read as one corner (island 22 px − 10 px inset = 12 px cards; `--card-radius` in `windows/src/style.css`). Never nest two equal or near-equal radii.
- Typography is Apple-like. macOS uses the system font (SF Pro). Windows and Linux use **Inter**, bundled from `@fontsource-variable/inter` (optical sizes) and never fetched from the web — the closest free match to SF Pro, whose licence only allows Apple platforms, so never ship SF Pro there. Always set text with `var(--font)`; don't introduce other typefaces.
- New views follow the existing app style. `design/prototype/notch-buddy.html` and `design/captures/` are references for new work, not a reason to change existing views.
